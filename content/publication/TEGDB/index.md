abstract: "Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) augment graph structures with natural language
descriptions, facilitating detailed depictions of data and their interconnections
across various real-world settings. However, existing TAG datasets predominantly
feature textual information only at the nodes, with edges typically represented by
mere binary or categorical attributes. This lack of rich textual edge annotations
significantly limits the exploration of contextual relationships between entities, hindering deeper insights into graph-structured data. To address this gap, we introduce Textual-Edge Graphs Datasets and Benchmark (TEG-DB), a comprehensive and
diverse collection of benchmark textual-edge datasets featuring rich textual descriptions on nodes and edges. The TEG-DB datasets are large-scale and encompass
a wide range of domains, from citation networks to social networks. In addition,
we conduct extensive benchmark experiments on TEG-DB to assess the extent to
which current techniques, including pre-trained language models, graph neural
networks, and their combinations, can utilize textual node and edge information.
**Our goal is to elicit advancements in textual-edge graph research, specifically in
developing methodologies that exploit rich textual node and edge descriptions to enhance graph analysis and provide deeper insights into complex real-world networks.** The entire TEG-DB project is publicly accessible as an open-source repository on
Github, accessible at https://github.com/Zhuofeng-Li/TEG-Benchmark."
