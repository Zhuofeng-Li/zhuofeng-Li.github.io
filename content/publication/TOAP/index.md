# abstract: "Script event stream prediction is a task that predicts events based on a given context or script. Most
# existing methods predict one subsequent event, limiting the ability to make a longer inference about the future.
# Moreover, external knowledge has been proven to be beneficial for event prediction and used in many methods
# in the form of relations between events. However, these methods focus mainly on the continuity of actions
# while ignoring the other components of events. To tackle these issues, we propose a Multi-step Script Event
# Stream Prediction (MuSEP) method that can make a longer inference according to the given events. We adopt
# reinforcement learning to implement the multi-step prediction by treating the process as a Markov chain and
# setting the reward considering both chain-level and event-level thus ensuring the overall quality of prediction results.
# Additionally, we learn the representations of events with external knowledge which could better understand events
# and their components. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that our method not only outperforms
# state-of-the-art methods on one-step prediction but is also capable of making multi-step prediction."
