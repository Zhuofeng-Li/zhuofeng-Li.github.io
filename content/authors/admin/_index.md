Hi, my name is Zhuofeng Li, a fourth year undergraduate student from Shanghai University. During 2024 Summer, I fortunately interned at Emory University supervised by Prof. [Liang Zhao](http://cs.emory.edu/~lzhao41/). 

My primary research focus lies in the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Data Mining for solving real-world problems including information retrieval and knowledge discovery. In the future, I would like to expand my research to Multimodal AI, including image, audio, and speech modalities. I'm also open to other topics. Please contact me if you'd like to chat!
